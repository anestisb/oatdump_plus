The situations in these tests were discovered by running the mutating
dexfuzz on the DEX files of fuzzingly random generated Java test.

(1) b/28908555:
    soft verification fail (on the final field modification) should
    not hide the hard verification fail (on the type mismatch) to
    avoid compiler crash later on.
(2) b/29070461:
    hard failure (not calling super in constructor) should bail
    immediately and not allow soft fails to pile up behind it to
    avoid fatal message later on
